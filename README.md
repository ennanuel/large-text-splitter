## SpliTXT

This repository contains the source files for a static web page.

### Description

A static webpage is a website that consists of pre-written HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. These files are delivered directly to the user's browser without the need for a server-side script to generate them dynamically. This makes static websites fast, secure, and easy to deploy.

This project utilizes static files to create a simple yet informative webpage.

### Getting Started

There are no specific dependencies required to run this static webpage. You can view the content directly by opening the `index.html` file in your web browser.

### Folder Structure

A typical static webpage project might have the following folder structure:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file of the website.
- `style.css`: Contains all the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) files that define the website's styles.
- `script.js` (optional): Contains any JavaScript files used for interactivity on the webpage.
- `assets`: Contains images, fonts, or other media files used on the webpage.
