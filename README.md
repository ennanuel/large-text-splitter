## Text Splitter: A Simple Tool for Working with Long Texts and Generative AI

This project provides a user-friendly interface for splitting large text files into smaller, more manageable sections suitable for use with generative AI models like Gemini and ChatGPT, which often have character limitations.

**Features:**

* **Simple and Intuitive:** Drag and drop or upload your text file and specify the desired maximum characters per section.
* **Customizable Splitting:** Choose the ideal character limit for your specific AI model and task.
* **Preserves Formatting:** Optionally, maintain basic formatting (paragraphs, line breaks) during the splitting process.
* **Static and Offline:** Works entirely in your browser, requiring no installation or external servers. 

**Benefits:**

* **Study Aid:** Quickly generate summaries of long texts (e.g., books) using generative AI models.
* **Content Management:** Break down lengthy content into digestible chunks for easier online consumption.
* **AI Experimentation:** Explore the capabilities of generative AI models with different text lengths.
* **Offline Processing:** Utilize the tool even without an internet connection.

**Technologies:**

* HTML: Structures the user interface and content flow.
* CSS: Styles the visual elements for a clean and user-friendly experience.
* JavaScript: Implements the text splitting logic and user interaction.

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone this repository or download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Type or copy and paste your text into the designated area.
4. Click "Split Text."
5. The split sections will be displayed below, ready for copying and pasting into your chosen AI model.

**Built With:**

* This project was built for personal use and learning purposes.

**Disclaimer:**

* The effectiveness of generated summaries may vary depending on the complexity of the text and the capabilities of the AI model used.

**Future Improvements:**

* Implement support for different file formats (e.g., .pdf, .doc, .docx)
* Explore advanced splitting techniques that consider sentence boundaries or semantic breaks.
* Add an option to download the split sections as separate files.

This text splitter is a valuable tool for anyone working with large text files and wanting to leverage the power of generative AI models. Feel free to customize and adapt it to your specific needs!
